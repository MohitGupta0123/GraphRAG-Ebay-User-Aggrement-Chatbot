International Buying and Selling; Translation \\nGiven the nature of eBay\\'s global marketplace, listings may be viewed and purchased \\nby, and shipped to, buyers around the world. Many of our Services are accessible \\ninternationally. We offer certain programs, tools, and experiences of particular interest to \\ninternational sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and \\ninternational shipping calculation tools. If, as a seller, you do not want your item to be \\nsold to buyers internationally, you can exclude countries or regions you don\\'t want to \\nship to by adjusting your shipping settings as provided in the International selling policy. \\nSellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations \\napplicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items. \\nIf you purchase an item on an eBay site that is different from your registration site, you \\nare subject to the User Agreement and applicable policies of that other eBay site with \\nrespect to that particular purchase, as detailed in the International selling policy. \\nFor sellers, you agree that we may display your listing for sale on an eBay site other \\nthan the site where you listed your item for sale, based on your shipping settings. You \\nmay adjust these settings as detailed in the International selling policy. If you list your \\nitems with an international shipping option, the appearance of your listings on sites \\nother than the listing site is not guaranteed. If you sell an item on an eBay site that is \\ndifferent from your registration or listing site, you are subject to the User Agreement and \\napplicable policies, including any buyer protection programs, of that other eBay site with \\nrespect to that particular sale, as detailed in the International selling policy. \\nYou authorize us to use automated tools to translate your eBay content, including \\nmember-to-member communications, in whole or in part, into local languages where \\nsuch translation solutions are available. We may provide you with tools which will \\nenable you to translate content at your request. The accuracy and availability of any \\ntranslation are not guaranteed. \\nOne of the ways we make eBay.com listings available to international buyers is through \\nthe eBay International Shipping Program (\"EIS\"). EIS enables buyers to obtain parcel \\nprocessing, international shipping, and customs clearance services. It is facilitated by \\neBay through third-party service providers that eBay has contracted with to \\noperationalize the program. By listing your item on eBay.com you agree to the EIS \\nTerms and Conditions. If you choose not to participate in EIS, you can opt out of the \\nprogram by updating your shipping preferences. \\n10.

Holds and Restricted Funds \\nTo protect eBay from risk of liability for your actions as a seller, eBay Payments Entities \\n(as defined below) may restrict access to your funds as described in the Payments \\nTerms of Use. \\n13. Authorization to Contact You; Recording Calls; Analyzing \\nMessage Content \\neBay may contact you using autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages, at any \\ntelephone number that you have provided us, to: (i) notify you regarding your account; \\n(ii) troubleshoot problems with your account; (iii) resolve a dispute; (iv) collect a debt; (v) \\npoll your opinions through surveys or questionnaires; or (vi) as otherwise necessary to \\nservice your account or enforce this User Agreement, our policies, applicable law, or \\nany other agreement we may have with you. eBay may also contact you using \\nautodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages for marketing purposes (e.g., offers \\nand promotions), if you consent to such communications. Our collection, use, \\ndisclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information is governed by our \\nUser Privacy Notice. As described in our User Privacy Notice, eBay may collect other \\ntelephone numbers for you and may place manual non-marketing calls to any of those \\nnumbers and autodialed non-marketing calls to any landline. Standard telephone minute \\nand text charges may apply and may include overage fees if you have exceeded your \\nplan limits. You may change your marketing communications preference for calls at any \\ntime, including through the Communication Preferences section of your My eBay. You \\nmay also opt out of a specific text marketing campaign by replying \"STOP\" to such \\nmarketing text message. \\neBay may share your telephone number with its authorized service providers as stated \\nin our User Privacy Notice. These service providers may contact you using autodialed \\nor prerecorded calls and text messages, only as authorized by eBay to carry out the \\npurposes identified above. \\neBay may, without further notice or warning and in its discretion, monitor or record \\ntelephone conversations you or anyone acting on your behalf has with eBay or its \\nagents for quality control and training purposes, or for its own protection. \\neBay\\'s automated systems scan and analyze the contents of every message sent \\nthrough its messaging platforms (including but not limited to chat and email channels), \\nincluding messages between users, to: (i) detect and prevent fraudulent activity or \\nviolations of eBay\\'s User Agreement, including the incorporated terms, notices, rules, \\nand policies and (ii) provide and improve our Services. This may result in a manual \\nreview of messages sent through our messaging tools. This scanning and analysis may \\noccur before, during, or after the message is sent, or while in storage, and may result in \\nyour message being delayed or withheld. eBay may store message contents, including \\nto conduct this scanning and analysis. \\nPrivacy of Others; Marketing \\nIf eBay provides you with information about another user, you agree you will use the \\ninformation only for the purposes that it is provided to you. You may not disclose or \\ndistribute a user\\'s information to a third party for purposes unrelated to our Services. \\nAdditionally, you may only send marketing communications to users who have \\nconsented to receive them in accordance with applicable laws, and only using eBay \\nServices. \\n14. Additional Terms \\nReturns and cancellations for sellers \\nSellers can create rules to automate replacements, returns, and refunds under certain \\ncircumstances. For all new sellers, in listings where returns are accepted, eBay will set \\na default rule that automates the return process. Sellers may remove or customize their \\nreturn preferences in their account settings within My eBay. Where settings have been \\nset to automatically accept requests for returns or replacements, an eBay-generated \\nreturn shipping label will be provided to your buyer. You agree to comply with our \\nreturns policy. \\nWhen an item is returned or if a transaction is canceled after payment has been \\ncompleted, eBay may issue a refund to the buyer on the seller\\'s behalf and charge the \\nseller for the amount of the refund. \\nAdditionally, eBay may charge sellers for the cost of return shipping labels and/or other \\nreasonable fees from sellers when: \\n●\\u200b An eBay-generated return shipping label is used, and the seller is responsible \\nfor its cost; \\n●\\u200b Returns have been automated; \\n●\\u200b The seller fails to send the buyer a return shipping label and, instead, an \\neBay-generated shipping label is used; and/or \\n●\\u200b The item is not as described in the listing and is returned in accordance with \\neBay Money Back Guarantee or other applicable terms. \\neBay or eBay Payment Entities may invoice sellers for these charges and collect such \\ncharges as described in the Payments Terms of Use. \\nAll seller cancellations of orders must be in accordance with our Order cancellation \\npolicy. \\nReturns and cancellations for buyers \\nBuyers generally do not have the right to cancel an order. Buyers can request to cancel \\nan order on eBay within the time period and as provided in our Order cancellation \\npolicy, and the seller will have 3 days to accept or decline the request. If the order \\ncannot be canceled, buyers may still be permitted to return the item if the item is\\u202feligible \\nfor return. \\nIn certain instances, a buyer may be responsible for the cost of return shipping for an \\nitem returned to a seller. If the buyer is responsible for the return shipping costs, the \\nbuyer may elect to use an eBay-generated shipping label or purchase a shipping label \\ndirectly from a carrier. By choosing to use an eBay-generated shipping label, you (as a \\nbuyer) agree that eBay may deduct the cost of the shipping label from the refund owed \\nto you. \\neBay Money Back Guarantee \\nMost eBay sales go smoothly, but if there\\'s a problem with a purchase covered by eBay \\nMoney Back Guarantee, buyers can get their money back if an item didn\\'t arrive, is \\nfaulty or damaged, or doesn\\'t match the listing. You agree to comply with the policy and \\npermit us to make a final decision on any eBay Money Back Guarantee case. \\nIf you (as seller) choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse a buyer or \\neBay under the eBay Money Back Guarantee, eBay or eBay Payments Entities may \\ninvoice you in the amount of the reimbursement, or collect the amount of the \\nreimbursement from you as described in the\\u202fPayments Terms of Use. If we cannot get \\nreimbursement from you, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection \\nmechanisms, including retaining collection agencies. \\nWe may suspend the eBay Money Back Guarantee in whole or in part without notice if \\nwe suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy. You agree to \\nmake us whole for any losses, including expenses we incur to recoup such losses, \\narising out of your abuse of the eBay Money Back Guarantee, or any fraud you commit \\nin connection with the eBay Money Back Guarantee. \\nRecommendations \\neBay may offer personalized recommendations to you to provide a relevant and \\nengaging experience, helping you sell or buy items of interest to you. These \\nrecommendations may consider data related to your eBay activity, the item, and \\nseasonality, among other factors. \\n15. Payment Services \\nPayments for goods and services sold using our Services are facilitated by designated \\neBay entities (each, an \"eBay Payment Entity\") pursuant to the Payments Terms of Use. \\nYou agree to the Payments Terms of Use to the extent applicable to you. To receive \\npayment for an item sold using our Services, you must accept and comply with the \\nPayments Terms of Use, including the requirements to provide to eBay Payment \\nEntities information about you, your business, and the financial account you will use to \\nreceive payments. \\nIf you are a buyer: \\n●\\u200b You may pay for items and services using the payment methods that the eBay \\nPayment Entities make available, and the eBay Payment Entities will manage \\nsettlement of the payment to sellers. The eBay Payment Entities will collect \\nthe transaction amount on behalf of the seller by charging your selected \\npayment method. Accordingly, payments received by\\u202fthe eBay Payment \\nEntity from you will satisfy your obligations to pay the seller in the amount of \\npayments received; \\n●\\u200b In certain instances, your transaction may be declined, frozen, or held for any \\nreason including for suspected fraud, Anti-Money Laundering (\"AML\") \\ncompliance, compliance with economic or trade sanctions, in connection with \\neBay\\'s internal risk controls or due to potential violations of any policy of eBay \\nor the eBay Payment Entity, or a policy of one of the Payment Entity\\'s \\nthird-party payment services providers; \\n●\\u200b eBay, the eBay Payment Entity or its affiliates may save payment information, \\nsuch as credit card or debit card numbers, and card expiration dates, entered \\nby you on our Services when you make a purchase, redeem a coupon, or \\nmake any other transaction on our Services where card information is \\nentered. Such stored payment information may be used as your default \\npayment method for future transactions on our Services. At any time, you can \\nupdate your card information or enter new card information, at which point the \\nnew card information shall be stored as your default payment method. You \\nmay make changes to your default payment method through the payment \\nsection in My eBay. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of \\ninformation we have on file, and you consent to eBay updating such stored \\ninformation from time to time based on information provided by you, your \\nbank or other payments services providers. You will only provide information \\nabout payment methods that you are authorized to use. By placing a payment \\nmethod on file with us, you authorize eBay Payment Entities to charge your \\npayment method(s) for any and all amounts arising from your use of our \\nServices, including charges to recover the proceeds of any fraud perpetrated \\nby you, or charges necessary to recoup amounts refunded to you in error; \\n●\\u200b You may seek returns or cancellations on our Services, or file eBay Money \\nBack Guarantee claims on our Services. If you are entitled to a refund, the \\neBay Payment Entities will issue the refund if the eBay Payment Entities \\nprocessed the original payment. Refund timing may vary in accordance with \\nthe rules of third parties, such as credit and debit card networks; \\n●\\u200b You agree to comply with, and not cause a third party to violate, all applicable \\nlaws, regulations, rules and terms and conditions in connection with the use \\nof the services provided by the eBay Payment Entities. You understand that \\nsome third parties, such as credit and debit card issuers, credit and debit card \\nnetworks and payments services providers, may have their own terms and \\nconditions for the payment or settlement methods you choose to use in \\nconnection with managed payments transactions. Failure to abide by \\nthird-party terms and conditions may result in fees assessed to you (for \\nexample, currency conversion fees from your credit card issuer if the \\ntransaction currency is different from your credit card currency) or other \\nactions taken by such third parties, and you agree that the eBay Payment \\nEntity has no control over, or responsibility or liability for, such fees or actions. \\n16.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE \\nGENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, WE (INCLUDING OUR PARENT, \\nSUBSIDIARIES, AND AFFILIATES, AND OUR AND THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, \\nAGENTS, AND EMPLOYEES) ARE NOT LIABLE, AND YOU AGREE NOT TO HOLD \\nUS RESPONSIBLE, FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT \\nLIMITED TO, LOSS OF MONEY, GOODWILL OR REPUTATION, PROFITS, OTHER \\nINTANGIBLE LOSSES, OR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL \\nDAMAGES) RESULTING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM: \\n●\\u200b the content you provide (directly or indirectly) using our Services; \\n●\\u200b your use of or your inability to use our Services; \\n●\\u200b pricing, shipping, format, or other guidance provided by eBay; \\n●\\u200b delays or disruptions in our Services; \\n●\\u200b viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing or linking to our \\nServices; \\n●\\u200b glitches, bugs, errors, or inaccuracies of any kind in our Services; \\n●\\u200b damage to your hardware device from the use of any eBay Service; \\n●\\u200b the content, actions, or inactions of third parties, including items listed using \\nour Services or the destruction of allegedly fake items; \\n●\\u200b a suspension or other action taken with respect to your account or breach of \\nthe Using eBay section above; \\n●\\u200b the duration or manner in which your listings appear in search results as set \\nout in the Listing Conditions section above; or \\n●\\u200b your need to modify practices, content, or behavior, or your loss of or inability \\nto do business, as a result of changes to this User Agreement or our policies. \\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so \\nsuch disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you. \\nRegardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or \\nto any third party is limited to the greatest of (a) any amounts due under the eBay \\nMoney Back Guarantee up to the price the item sold for on eBay (including any \\napplicable sales tax) plus its original shipping costs, (b) the amount of fees in dispute, \\nnot to exceed the total fees you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise \\nto the liability, or (c) $100. \\n17.

Indemnity \\nYou will indemnify and hold us (including our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as our \\nand their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents) harmless from any claim \\nor demand, including reasonable legal fees, made by any third party due to or arising \\nout of your breach of this User Agreement, your improper use of our Services or your \\nbreach of any law or the rights of a third party. \\n19. Legal Disputes \\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND \\nWILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND EBAY HAVE \\nAGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED. \\nIn this Legal Disputes section, the term \"related third parties\" includes your and \\neBay\\'s respective affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies, predecessors, \\nsuccessors, assigns, as well as your, eBay\\'s, and these entities\\' respective \\nemployees and agents. \\nYou and eBay each agree that any and all claims or disputes at law or equity that \\nhas arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (or any related third parties) that \\nrelate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of this User \\nAgreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its \\nagents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the \\nServices, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal \\nDisputes section. \\nA. Applicable Law \\nYou and eBay agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal \\nlaw, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will \\ngovern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise \\nbetween you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement. \\nB. Agreement to Arbitrate \\nYou and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims between you and \\neBay (or any related third parties) that arise out of or relate in any way to this or \\nprevious versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to our Services, \\nthe actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or \\npurchased through our Services, including the scope or applicability of this \\nAgreement to Arbitrate (each, a \"Dispute\") shall be resolved exclusively through \\nfinal and binding arbitration, rather than in court. The exceptions to this Agreement \\nto Arbitrate are: (1) you or eBay may seek relief in small claims court if such claims \\nqualify and remain in small claims court; and (2) you or eBay may seek equitable relief \\nin court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as \\ntrademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For \\npurposes of this Agreement to Arbitrate, \"Dispute\" will also include disputes that arose \\nor involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the User \\nAgreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this User \\nAgreement, unless those disputes were noticed prior to this User Agreement. \\n1.\\u200b Informal Dispute Resolution\\u200b\\nIf a Dispute arises between you and eBay, eBay is committed to working with \\nyou to reach a prompt, low‐cost and mutually reasonable resolution. You and \\neBay agree to participate in good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes \\nbefore starting an arbitration or initiating an action in small claims court \\n(\"Informal Dispute Resolution\"). To initiate Informal Dispute Resolution, a \\nparty must give notice to the other party in writing in a valid Notice of Dispute \\n(\"Notice\"), which may be downloaded at this link. Such Notice to eBay should \\nbe sent by email to DisputeNotice@eBay.com or regular mail to our offices \\nlocated at 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to \\nyou to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay \\naccount; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To \\nbe valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on \\nthe Notice form, including a description of the claims you are asserting, the \\nspecific relief sought, and the user name, email address and phone number \\nassociated with your account.\\u200b\\nThe Informal Dispute Resolution process lasts 45 days and is a mandatory \\nprecondition to commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any \\nfiling deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in Informal Dispute \\nResolution. \\n2.\\u200b Waiver of Jury Trial\\u200b\\nYOU AND EBAY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND \\nSTATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT \\nOF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and eBay are instead electing that all \\nDisputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Agreement to Arbitrate, \\nexcept as specified in Section 19.B (\"Agreement to Arbitrate\"). \\n3.\\u200b Waiver of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized \\nRelief\\u200b\\nEACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN \\nINDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR \\nCOLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS \\nTO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, \\nRESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR \\nREPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE. \\nSubject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, the arbitrator may award declaratory or \\ninjunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to \\nthe extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual \\nclaim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms \\nand conditions under Section 19.B.7 (\"Batch Arbitration\").\\u200b\\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement to Arbitrate, if a \\nfinal decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, determines that \\nthe limitations of this Section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular \\nclaim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you \\nand eBay agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that \\nparticular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and \\nmay be brought in court (pursuant to Section 19.C below), subject to your and \\neBay\\'s right to appeal the court\\'s decision. All other Disputes, aside from \\nthose explicitly exempted in Sections 19.B (above), shall be arbitrated. This \\nsection does not prevent you or eBay from participating in a class-wide \\nsettlement of claims. \\n4.\\u200b Arbitration Procedures\\u200b\\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral \\narbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is \\nvery limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief \\non an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An \\narbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. The \\narbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, \\nwithout limitation, disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the \\nAgreement to Arbitrate, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or \\nvalidity of the Agreement to Arbitrate or any portion of the Agreement to \\nArbitrate, except that all Disputes regarding Section 19.B.3 (\"Waiver of Class \\nand Other Non-Individualized Relief\") including any claim that all or part of \\nthat Section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section \\nhas been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and \\nnot by an arbitrator.\\u200b\\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Unsatisfied \\njudgments on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having \\njurisdiction. This User Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate \\ncommerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the \\napplicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., \\nwill govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate \\nand any arbitration, including the procedures governing Batch Arbitration.\\u200b\\nIf Informal Dispute Resolution does not resolve satisfactorily within 45 days \\nafter receipt of a Notice, you and eBay agree that either party shall have the \\nright to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration \\nwill be administered by National Arbitration & Mediation (\"NAM\") in \\naccordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and \\nProcedure (the \"NAM Comprehensive Rules\") in effect at the time of \\narbitration, except as supplemented, where applicable, by the NAM \\nSupplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings (the \"NAM Mass Filing \\nRules\"; together with the NAM Comprehensive Rules, the \"NAM Rules\"), and \\nas modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The NAM Rules are currently \\navailable at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/. If NAM is \\nunavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be \\nselected by the parties or, if the parties cannot reach agreement, the court \\n(pursuant to Section 19.C below) shall select the administrator.\\u200b\\nA party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a \\ndemand for arbitration (the \"Demand\"). A Demand to eBay should be sent by \\nmail to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT \\n84020. If eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a Demand to the \\nphysical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your \\nresponsibility to keep your physical address up to date. A Demand form is \\navailable on NAM\\'s site at \\nhttps://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2024/09/Revised-Comprehensive-D\\nemand-for-Arb-9.17.24.pdf. The Demand must include: (1) the name, \\ntelephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address, and eBay user name of \\nthe party seeking arbitration, including a statement whether the party is a U.S. \\nresident; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual \\nbases for those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an \\naccurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy; (4) a statement \\ncertifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described \\nabove; and (5) a statement certifying that the requesting party will pay any \\nnecessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. If the party \\nrequesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Demand shall also \\ninclude counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email \\naddress. Such counsel must also sign the Demand.\\u200b\\nIf you are a U.S. resident, and unless you and eBay otherwise agree, the \\narbitration, including any in-person arbitration hearing, will be conducted in \\nthe county where you reside or, in the case of Batch Arbitration, as \\ndetermined by the arbitrator. If you are not a resident of the United States, \\nthen the arbitration, including any in-person arbitration hearing, will be held in \\nSalt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. \\nSubject to the NAM Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable \\nexchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited \\nnature of the arbitration. You and eBay agree that all materials and \\ndocuments exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept \\nconfidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, \\naccountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that \\nthey agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the \\narbitration proceedings confidential. You and eBay agree that at least 14 days \\nbefore the date set for an arbitration hearing, any party may serve an offer in \\nwriting upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer \\nmade by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails \\nto obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover any \\npost-offer costs to which they otherwise would be entitled and shall pay the \\noffering party’s costs from the time of the offer.\\u200b\\nThe parties agree that the arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in \\naccordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and \\nwill honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The parties agree that the \\narbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different \\nusers but shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same \\neBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator\\'s award \\nshall be final and binding, and an unsatisfied judgment on the award rendered \\nby the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. \\n5.\\u200b Arbitrator\\u200b\\nThe arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney and will be selected \\nby the parties from the NAM’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators, provided \\nthat if the Batch Arbitration process is triggered, NAM will appoint the \\narbitrator for each batch without soliciting input or feedback from any party. If \\nthe parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 35 days of delivery of \\nthe Demand, then NAM will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the NAM \\nRules. \\n6.\\u200b Fees and Costs\\u200b\\nPayment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by \\nthe applicable NAM fee schedules (the \"Fee Schedules\"), but may be \\nreapportioned between the parties in accordance with this Agreement to \\nArbitrate, as follows: if you complied with the Informal Dispute Resolution \\nrequirements in Section 1 of this Agreement and the value of the relief sought \\nin the Dispute is $10,000 or less, at your request eBay will pay all filing, \\nadministration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. The parties \\nshall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the \\narbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in \\nthe Demand was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as \\nmeasured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). \\nTo the extent, following a presentation on the merits, on its own motion or a \\nparty’s, and after affording a reasonable opportunity to respond, an arbitrator \\ndetermines that a party who commenced arbitration did not bring its claim(s) \\nconsistent with counsel’s Certification and the standards set forth in Federal \\nRule of Civil Procedure 11(b), the arbitrator may, as part of its award, impose \\nsanctions by ordering that the initiating party reimburse the responding party \\nfor all arbitration costs and arbitrators’ fees the responding party incurred \\nunder the Fee Schedule. \\n7.\\u200b Batch Arbitration\\u200b\\nTo increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you \\nand eBay agree that in the event that there are 25 or more individual \\nDemands of a substantially similar nature filed against eBay by or with the \\nassistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations \\n(\"Claimant’s Counsel\"), within a reasonably proximate period of time, for \\nexample, a 90 day period, NAM shall (1) administer the arbitration demands \\nin batches of 100 Demands per batch (or, if between 25 and 99 individual \\nDemands are filed, a single batch of all those Demands, and, to the extent \\nthere are less than 100 Demands remaining after the batching described \\nabove, a final batch consisting of the remaining Demands); (2) appoint one \\narbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch on a \\nconsolidated basis with one set of filing and administrative fees due per \\nbatch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be selected \\nby Claimant’s Counsel or, if Claimant’s Counsel does not have a preference, \\nby the arbitrator, and one final award, which will provide for any and all relief \\nto which the arbitrator determines each individual party is entitled (\"Batch \\nArbitration\"). NAM shall administer all batches concurrently, to the extent \\npossible.\\u200b\\nAll parties agree that Demands are of a \"substantially similar nature\" if they \\narise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same \\nor similar legal issue(s) and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the \\nparties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the \\ndisagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM shall appoint a sole standing \\nProcedural Arbitrator or, should the circumstances so require, an Emergency \\nArbitrator, according to the NAM Rules, to determine the applicability of the \\nBatch Arbitration process (the Procedural Arbitrator or Emergency Arbitrator, \\nthe \"Administrative Arbitrator\"). To expedite resolution of any such dispute \\nby the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator \\nmay set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes \\npromptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by eBay.\\u200b\\nYou and eBay agree to cooperate in good faith with NAM to implement the \\nBatch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and \\nadministrative fees for batches of Demands, as well as any steps to minimize \\nthe time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a \\ndiscovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery \\ndisputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration \\nproceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as \\nauthorizing a class, collective and/or representative arbitration or action of \\nany kind, except as expressly set forth in this provision, and nothing about the \\nBatch Arbitration process will preclude any party from participating in any \\narbitration administered according to that process. \\n8.\\u200b Severability\\u200b\\nExcept as provided in Section 19.B.3 (\"Waiver of Class or Other \\nNon-Individualized Relief\"), if any part or parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate \\n(other than Section 19.B.7 (\"Batch Arbitration\")) are found under the law to be \\ninvalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force \\nand effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement to \\nArbitrate shall continue in full force and effect. However, if Section 19.B.7 \\n(\"Batch Arbitration\") of this Agreement to Arbitrate is found under the law to \\nbe invalid or unenforceable then, in that case, the entire Agreement to \\nArbitrate shall be void, and the parties agree that all Disputes will be heard in \\nthe state or federal courts located in Salt Lake County, Utah as required in \\nSection 19.C. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with eBay as \\ndetailed in this Agreement to Arbitrate must be initiated within the applicable \\nstatute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time \\nbarred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply \\nto such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would \\napply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction. \\n9.\\u200b Opt-Out Procedure\\u200b\\nYOU CAN CHOOSE TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE \\n(\"OPT OUT\") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (\"OPT-OUT \\nNOTICE\"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER \\nTHAN THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AMENDMENT OR 30 DAYS FROM \\nTHE DATE YOU FIRST ACCEPT THIS USER AGREEMENT.

You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective.

Neither you nor eBay waives any right to arbitration \\nthat may apply to any current or pending lawsuit, arbitration, or legal \\nproceeding commenced prior to the effective date of this Agreement to \\nArbitrate.\\u202f If you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of this \\nUser Agreement and its Legal Disputes section will continue to apply to you. \\n10.\\u200bFuture Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate\\u200b\\nNotwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and \\nwe agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate \\n(other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) \\nin the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim already filed in \\narbitration (or, where permitted, in court or small claims court) against eBay \\nprior to the effective date of the amendment.

Waiver of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE. Subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.B.7 (\"Batch Arbitration\"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement to Arbitrate, if a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, determines that the limitations of this Section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and eBay agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court (pursuant to Section 19.C below), subject to your and eBay's right to appeal the court's decision. All other Disputes, aside from those explicitly exempted in Sections 19.B (above), shall be arbitrated. This section does not prevent you or eBay from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. 4. Arbitration Procedures Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Agreement to Arbitrate, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate or any portion of the Agreement to Arbitrate, except that all Disputes regarding Section 19.B.3 (\"Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief\") including any claim that all or part of that Section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Unsatisfied judgments on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This User Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate and any arbitration, including the procedures governing Batch Arbitration. If Informal Dispute Resolution does not resolve satisfactorily within 45 days after receipt of a Notice, you and eBay agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration Mediation (\"NAM\") in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedure (the \"NAM Comprehensive Rules\") in effect at the time of arbitration, except as supplemented, where applicable, by the NAM Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings (the \"NAM Mass Filing Rules\"; together with the NAM Comprehensive Rules, the \"NAM Rules\"), and as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The NAM Rules are currently available at If NAM is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the parties cannot reach agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 19.C below) shall select the administrator. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a demand for arbitration (the \"Demand\"). A Demand to eBay should be sent by mail to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. If eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a Demand to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. A Demand form is available on NAM's site at --- emand-for-Arb-9.17.24.pdf. The Demand must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, email address, and eBay user name of the party seeking arbitration, including a statement whether the party is a U.S. resident; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases for those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, goodfaith calculation of the amount in controversy; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) a statement certifying that the requesting party will pay any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Demand shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Demand. If you are a U.S. resident, and unless you and eBay otherwise agree, the arbitration, including any in-person arbitration hearing, will be conducted in the county where you reside or, in the case of Batch Arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator. If you are not a resident of the United States, then the arbitration, including any in-person arbitration hearing, will be held in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Subject to the NAM Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. You and eBay agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential. You and eBay agree that at least 14 days before the date set for an arbitration hearing, any party may serve an offer in writing upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover any post-offer costs to which they otherwise would be entitled and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer. The parties agree that the arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and an unsatisfied judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 5. Arbitrator The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney and will be selected by the parties from the NAM’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process is triggered, NAM will appoint the arbitrator for each batch without soliciting input or feedback from any party. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 35 days of delivery of the Demand, then NAM will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the NAM Rules. 6. Fees and Costs Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the applicable NAM fee schedules (the \"Fee Schedules\"), but may be reapportioned between the parties in accordance with this Agreement to Arbitrate, as follows: if you complied with the Informal Dispute Resolution requirements in Section 1 of this Agreement and the value of the relief sought in the Dispute is $10,000 or less, at your request eBay will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Demand was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). To the extent, following a presentation on the merits, on its own motion or a party’s, and after affording a reasonable opportunity to respond, an arbitrator determines that a party who commenced arbitration did not bring its claim(s) consistent with counsel’s Certification and the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), the arbitrator may, as part of its award, impose sanctions by ordering that the initiating party reimburse the responding party for all arbitration costs and arbitrators’ fees the responding party incurred under the Fee Schedule. 7. Batch Arbitration To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and eBay agree that in the event that there are 25 or more individual Demands of a substantially similar nature filed against eBay by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations (\"Claimant’s Counsel\"), within a reasonably proximate period of time, for example, a 90 day period, NAM shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Demands per batch (or, if between 25 and 99 individual Demands are filed, a single batch of all those Demands, and, to the extent there are less than 100 Demands remaining after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Demands); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch on a consolidated basis with one set of filing and administrative fees due per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be selected by Claimant’s Counsel or, if Claimant’s Counsel does not have a preference, by the arbitrator, and one final award, which will provide for any and all relief to which the arbitrator determines each individual party is entitled (\"Batch Arbitration\"). NAM shall administer all batches concurrently, to the extent possible. All parties agree that Demands are of a \"substantially similar nature\" if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issue(s) and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM shall appoint a sole standing Procedural Arbitrator or, should the circumstances so require, an Emergency Arbitrator, according to the NAM Rules, to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (the Procedural Arbitrator or Emergency Arbitrator, the \"Administrative Arbitrator\"). To expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by eBay. You and eBay agree to cooperate in good faith with NAM to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Demands, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or representative arbitration or action of any kind, except as expressly set forth in this provision, and nothing about the Batch Arbitration process will preclude any party from participating in any arbitration administered according to that process. 8. Severability Except as provided in Section 19.B.3 (\"Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief\"), if any part or parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than Section 19.B.7 (\"Batch Arbitration\")) are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall continue in full force and effect. However, if Section 19.B.7 (\"Batch Arbitration\") of this Agreement to Arbitrate is found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable then, in that case, the entire Agreement to Arbitrate shall be void, and the parties agree that all Disputes will be heard in the state or federal courts located in Salt Lake County, Utah as required in Section 19.C. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with eBay as detailed in this Agreement to Arbitrate must be initiated within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction. 9. Opt-Out Procedure YOU CAN CHOOSE TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (\"OPT OUT\") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (\"OPT-OUT NOTICE\"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AMENDMENT OR 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU FIRST ACCEPT THIS USER AGREEMENT. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO EBAY INC., ATTN: LITIGATION DEPARTMENT, RE: OPT-OUT NOTICE, 583 WEST EBAY WAY, DRAPER, UT 84020. For your convenience, we are providing an Opt-Out Notice form. You must complete, sign, and mail that to us to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. Any Opt-Out Notice will be effective only if you send it yourself, on an individual basis, and opt-out notices from any third party purporting to act on your behalf will have no effect on your or eBay’s rights. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any arbitration agreement(s) you may currently have with us, including any previous version of this Agreement to Arbitrate to which you agreed; all such prior arbitration agreements remain in effect unless superseded by this Agreement, and you cannot use this procedure to opt out of any previous version of this Agreement to Arbitrate. Neither you nor eBay waives any right to arbitration that may apply to any current or pending lawsuit, arbitration, or legal proceeding commenced prior to the effective date of this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of this User Agreement and its Legal Disputes section will continue to apply to you. 10.Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate Notwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim already filed in arbitration (or, where permitted, in court or small claims court) against eBay prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and eBay. We will notify you of material amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate. We will provide you 30 days' notice by posting the amended terms on Additionally, we will notify you through the eBay Message Center and/or by email.

C. Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes If the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim, request for relief, or Dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute between you and eBay will be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Salt Lake County, Utah. You and eBay agree to submit exclusively to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Salt Lake County, Utah for the purpose of litigating all such claims, disputes, or matters. 20. General Except as otherwise provided in this User Agreement, if any provision of this User Agreement is held to be invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable, such provision shall be struck out and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

Subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.B.7 (\"Batch Arbitration\"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement to Arbitrate, if a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, determines that the limitations of this Section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and eBay agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court (pursuant to Section 19.C below), subject to your and eBay\\'s right to appeal the court\\'s decision. All other Disputes, aside from those explicitly exempted in Sections 19.B (above), shall be arbitrated. This section does not prevent you or eBay from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. 4. Arbitration Procedures Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Agreement to Arbitrate, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate or any portion of the Agreement to Arbitrate, except that all Disputes regarding Section 19.B.3 (\"Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief\") including any claim that all or part of that Section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Unsatisfied judgments on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This User Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate and any arbitration, including the procedures governing Batch Arbitration. If Informal Dispute Resolution does not resolve satisfactorily within 45 days after receipt of a Notice, you and eBay agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration Mediation (\"NAM\") in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedure (the \"NAM Comprehensive Rules\") in effect at the time of arbitration, except as supplemented, where applicable, by the NAM Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings (the \"NAM Mass Filing Rules\"; together with the NAM Comprehensive Rules, the \"NAM Rules\"), and as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The NAM Rules are currently available at If NAM is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the parties cannot reach agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 19.C below) shall select the administrator. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a demand for arbitration (the \"Demand\"). A Demand to eBay should be sent by mail to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. If eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a Demand to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. A Demand form is available on NAM\\'s site at --- emand-for-Arb-9.17.24.pdf. The Demand must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, email address, and eBay user name of the party seeking arbitration, including a statement whether the party is a U.S. resident; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases for those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, goodfaith calculation of the amount in controversy; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) a statement certifying that the requesting party will pay any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Demand shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Demand. If you are a U.S. resident, and unless you and eBay otherwise agree, the arbitration, including any in-person arbitration hearing, will be conducted in the county where you reside or, in the case of Batch Arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator. If you are not a resident of the United States, then the arbitration, including any in-person arbitration hearing, will be held in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Subject to the NAM Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. You and eBay agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential. You and eBay agree that at least 14 days before the date set for an arbitration hearing, any party may serve an offer in writing upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover any post-offer costs to which they otherwise would be entitled and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer. The parties agree that the arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator\\'s award shall be final and binding, and an unsatisfied judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 5. Arbitrator The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney and will be selected by the parties from the NAM’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process is triggered, NAM will appoint the arbitrator for each batch without soliciting input or feedback from any party. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 35 days of delivery of the Demand, then NAM will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the NAM Rules. 6. Fees and Costs Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the applicable NAM fee schedules (the \"Fee Schedules\"), but may be reapportioned between the parties in accordance with this Agreement to Arbitrate, as follows: if you complied with the Informal Dispute Resolution requirements in Section 1 of this Agreement and the value of the relief sought in the Dispute is $10,000 or less, at your request eBay will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Demand was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). To the extent, following a presentation on the merits, on its own motion or a party’s, and after affording a reasonable opportunity to respond, an arbitrator determines that a party who commenced arbitration did not bring its claim(s) consistent with counsel’s Certification and the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), the arbitrator may, as part of its award, impose sanctions by ordering that the initiating party reimburse the responding party for all arbitration costs and arbitrators’ fees the responding party incurred under the Fee Schedule. 7. Batch Arbitration To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and eBay agree that in the event that there are 25 or more individual Demands of a substantially similar nature filed against eBay by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations (\"Claimant’s Counsel\"), within a reasonably proximate period of time, for example, a 90 day period, NAM shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Demands per batch (or, if between 25 and 99 individual Demands are filed, a single batch of all those Demands, and, to the extent there are less than 100 Demands remaining after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Demands); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch on a consolidated basis with one set of filing and administrative fees due per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be selected by Claimant’s Counsel or, if Claimant’s Counsel does not have a preference, by the arbitrator, and one final award, which will provide for any and all relief to which the arbitrator determines each individual party is entitled (\"Batch Arbitration\"). NAM shall administer all batches concurrently, to the extent possible. All parties agree that Demands are of a \"substantially similar nature\" if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issue(s) and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM shall appoint a sole standing Procedural Arbitrator or, should the circumstances so require, an Emergency Arbitrator, according to the NAM Rules, to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (the Procedural Arbitrator or Emergency Arbitrator, the \"Administrative Arbitrator\"). To expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by eBay. You and eBay agree to cooperate in good faith with NAM to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Demands, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or representative arbitration or action of any kind, except as expressly set forth in this provision, and nothing about the Batch Arbitration process will preclude any party from participating in any arbitration administered according to that process. 8. Severability Except as provided in Section 19.B.3 (\"Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief\"), if any part or parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than Section 19.B.7 (\"Batch Arbitration\")) are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall continue in full force and effect. However, if Section 19.B.7 (\"Batch Arbitration\") of this Agreement to Arbitrate is found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable then, in that case, the entire Agreement to Arbitrate shall be void, and the parties agree that all Disputes will be heard in the state or federal courts located in Salt Lake County, Utah as required in Section 19.C. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with eBay as detailed in this Agreement to Arbitrate must be initiated within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction. 9. Opt-Out Procedure YOU CAN CHOOSE TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (\"OPT OUT\") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (\"OPT-OUT NOTICE\"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AMENDMENT OR 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU FIRST ACCEPT THIS USER AGREEMENT. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO EBAY INC., ATTN: LITIGATION DEPARTMENT, RE: OPT-OUT NOTICE, 583 WEST EBAY WAY, DRAPER, UT 84020. For your convenience, we are providing an Opt-Out Notice form. You must complete, sign, and mail that to us to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. Any Opt-Out Notice will be effective only if you send it yourself, on an individual basis, and opt-out notices from any third party purporting to act on your behalf will have no effect on your or eBay’s rights. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any arbitration agreement(s) you may currently have with us, including any previous version of this Agreement to Arbitrate to which you agreed; all such prior arbitration agreements remain in effect unless superseded by this Agreement, and you cannot use this procedure to opt out of any previous version of this Agreement to Arbitrate. Neither you nor eBay waives any right to arbitration that may apply to any current or pending lawsuit, arbitration, or legal proceeding commenced prior to the effective date of this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of this User Agreement and its Legal Disputes section will continue to apply to you. 10.Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate Notwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim already filed in arbitration (or, where permitted, in court or small claims court) against eBay prior to the effective date of the amendment.

You and eBay agree to submit exclusively to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Salt Lake County, Utah for the purpose of litigating all such claims, disputes, or matters. 20.
